Part I: Polymorphism in C

# task 1

Succesfully created a doubly linked list in C that can perfom all the functionalities for a 
linked list. My test file worked properly. Major Obstacles personally on this part of the project
 were actually constructing my linkedlist keeping in mind the functionality for pointers in C,
 something I clearly do not understand very well. After completing this project, my confidence with
 understand those functionalities grew, as implementing a linkedlist in C is very different from 
 how I did it in Java, mainly due to memory allocation differences. 
 ->The test file outputs are in my "Int llist output 1&2" images
 
 
 I extended the testfile to also work for char types and for that I added new operator functions
 very similar to the previos Int operator function but for Char types.
