# task 1

I ran my code using the double if statements I created and it worked well. My encode2.yy flex file made perfect sense 
to me, but it did not compile well. 
For this task, using the ascii values for each letter given by turning a char into an int, I was able to figure out a forloop that 
could achieve for me the required result. 

# task 2

Here I learnt the hard way that the order of the rules actually matters a great deal. I initialized fields 
in my definitions to actually do calculations, through tallying each time a desired output is observed. 

# task 3

This is where I struggled the most. 
My rule solution began first by replacing all the <p> with a blank line, skipping matches html
 tags without regard to to attributes, skipping white spaces and then actually printing out
all the information inbetween the tags. Running my program I got the result task3output.txt. 

# task 4

My parser worked well and I got the result task4Image

# extension 1

To capture comments inbetween "/* */", I created two rules that mark the defining boundaries for content in between commentss.
The "ext1Image" file showcases this extension. 

# extension 4

I created an additional hello world program for javascript
