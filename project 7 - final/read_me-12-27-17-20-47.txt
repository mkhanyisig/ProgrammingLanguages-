*****Part I: Memory Management in C

What is the average time per call to allocate a certain amount of memory?
> to achieve this, my code solution allocated char memory using malloc, as each char is 1 byte size
in size.This was repeated for 1000 memory allocations of the same size. I timed my calls for three 
different memory sizes (small, medium & large) , which were allocated more than a thousand times each 
and the averages were found. The resulting screenshot from running the program memory.c illustrates 
the different memory time stamps which resulted. The last call times a random memory size allocation  
which varies with time.

*****Extenstions
The only extension I undertook was doing memory management for Javascript
